To get the program running, you only need a java compiler and runtime (Java 8 is enough).
Do "javac *.java" in the root folder to compile, "java Edox" to run.
To learn the controls, select "Open Book" from the file menu, and pick
the "00 Basics.xml" inside "Practical Tuning - Express Edition".
Once you're done with the short tutorial, pick "12 Tone Keyboard" or
"Freeboard" from the tools menu to get going. "Player" and "Tuning Practice"
tabs do nothing and will be removed at a later date.
